Personality Quiz determines whether the user is a introvert or extrovert by asking them a series of questions and at the end gives the user their introvert and extrovert percentage.

The Introvert and Extrovert classes output questions and inputs answers from the user. The PersonalityQuizGUI creates the program's GUI and calls the Introvert and Extrovert classes.

The program's GUI consists of a large text area which displays the questions, a input field which accepts the user's input, and a button which submits the user's input. The user only needs to type either 1 or 2 in the input field.
